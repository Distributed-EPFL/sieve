This is an example application that uses batched sieve to spread messages in a distributed system.

This showcases the use of both drop and batched sieve for real-life applications (though it is very simple).

For simplicity all arguments are provided on the command line. 

You can run it using `cargo run`. To better understand what are the purpose of each argument, use `cargo run -- --help`.
